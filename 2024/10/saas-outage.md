        ```
    - SB suspected this was an OS issue from the error message and checked the AWS EC2 console, noticed that the EC2 nodes had been updated at 05:33 and workloads had been migrated to the new EC2 nodes after that.
    - He checked the version of the OS, noted it was v1.26.0 and looked for issues with this OS in the Bottlerocket GitHub repo. He found [Issue 4260](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/issues/4260) - Compatibility issues with the v1.26.0 of Bottlerocket when running Java-based applications.
- 24-10-2024 08:50 - TB arrived and SB handed the issue over to TB.
    - As SB had already diagnosed the cause of the issue TB started the process of reverting all of the EC2 instances in the SaaS production account back to [v1.25.0](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/releases/tag/v1.25.0)
- 24-10-2024 09:15 - Customer instances started to come back online and service was restored.

## Root Cause

[PR-158](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-core-kit/pull/158) was merged into the Bottlerocket default branch, this was then released in [v1.26.0](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/releases/tag/v1.26.0). This change to the OS config stopped applications that rely on JIT compilation, such as Java, from executing on v1.26.0 of the Bottlerocket OS.

The [documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#:~:text=MemoryDenyWriteExecute) for this OS feature make it very clear that turning it on will affect Java applications
```
Note that this option is incompatible with programs and libraries that generate program code dynamically
at runtime, including JIT execution engines, executable stacks, and code "trampoline" feature of various
C compilers.
```

## Resolution and recovery

## Corrective and Preventative Measures 

1. Changes have been made to the Karpenter resources so that we deploy a specific versioned Bottlerocket AMI rather than the latest released AMI. This increases the maintenatnce burden on the technology team and may result in critical security patch deployment being delayed.
1. Bottlerocket release ATOM feed has been added to an internal tooling release dashboard.
1. A public status page will be setup to communicate to users transparently.
